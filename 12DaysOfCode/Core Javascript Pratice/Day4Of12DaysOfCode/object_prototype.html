    <h1>Prototype</h1> 
    <h2>In javascrpt every object is associated with another object</h2>
    <h2>If we create an object i.e. var obj = {} in this obj is associated with object.protorype of object obj</h2>
    <h2>All the properties of object.prototype is inherited to obj</h2>
    <h2>Note: Prototype Object of Object.prototype is null</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>var b1 = new Object() this creates a constructor and we call it as "Prototype property of the Constructor function which in this case Object.prototype is prototype Object of Object b1</h2>
    <h2>i.e. b1 will inherit all the properties of object.prototype</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>var b2 = new Array() this creates also a constructor and we call it same just prototype.object is changed to array.prototype and it prototype of b2</h2>
    <h2>Note: Prototype Object of Array.prototype is Object.prototype and Prototype object of object.prototype is null</h2>
    <h2>This means b2 is object and it associated by Array.prototype and Array.Prototype is associated by Object.Prototype and Object.prototype is associated by Null. Null is in top of all</h2>
