### the hirechry of DOM is fully different the previous we learned was incomplete
### so, in DOM for every enter, space, tab pressed through
### keyboard creates a text node
###  <h1 id="myid">
### We are learning Js 
### <!-- This is comment -->
###  </h1>
###  <p id="myid1">I am paragraph</p>
### in this h1 element has 2 childs one is text and another is comment but
### after finishing the h1 tag we press enter and wrote text 
### the enter which is pressed is the text element which is created
### like this for every tab, space, and enter DOM creats new elements

### Element Node is said to be the elements which are created form Html as children and other
### are Node of the Element which are text, tab, space , comment and others
