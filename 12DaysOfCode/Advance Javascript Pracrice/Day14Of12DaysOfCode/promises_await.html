        //promises
        //promises are used to handle asynchronous operation in s, they are easy to manage when dealing with
        //multiple asychronous operation where callbacks are created callback hel leading to unmanageable code.
        //A promise is an object which keep track about whether a certain event has happened already or not

        //it has 3 stages
        //1. pending
        //2. resolve
        //3. reject

        //we can create promise in 2 ways 
        //1. constructor
        //2. object

        //need to call an executer function which holds 2 parameter 
        //one is resole which will executed by then i.e. no error only the values
        //another is reject which will executed by catch i.e. if there is error then it will throw it
        var pro_obj = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
            setTimeout(() => {
                var arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6];

                // reject('there is errror');

        //Async await
        //to avoid promises we use async await
        //we we uses promises then it can be called by then or catch
        //but by async await we get more clearity in the execution of the promises
        //async before a function means one sample thing: a function always return promises
        //so the async function is added to tell them to return a promices
        //rather then directly reurning the value
        //we use await when calling any function that return promises, including web APIs
        //the keyword await makes javascript wait until that promices settle and return values

        //async makes function ansynchronous which helps to executes it without a condition
        async function getdata() {
            //await set the promise to wait and return the value 
            const data_ = await pro_obj;
            console.log(data_);

        var getvalue = getdata().then((myname)=>{
            console.log(myname);
        });
        //promises takes time to execute so the stage is set to be pending
        //and it will return pending
        // console.log(getvalue);
