        //HTML Attributes are like 
        // class, id ,title ,etc these are the personal property of H2 tag element
        //but DOM Property are those which comes inherited form NODE then ELEMENT then HTMLELEMENT the H2 element
        //so all the properties form up comes down to H2 tag element
        //it has few own property but has inherited property of NODE, ELEMENT, HTMLELEMENT

        //Attributes
        //it retuns the list of nodes of all attributes it has in the element

        //setAttribute - we can create new attribute through this methord
        //getAttribute - view the attributes what it has
        //this methord creates attributes of the element. if attributes existed it updates the attributes
        //we should not use inline style then it will overwride the CSS properties
        //syntax :- Element.setAttributes(name,value);
        //syntax :- Element.setAttributes("style","css properties:value");

        //HTML-DOM Mapping
        //the attributes of element is mapped with DOM property so we can do access the attributes of elements
        //there are some properties that is similar to DOM and HTML property so 
        //DOM changed them to their own properties like 
        //class - lassName
        //fontSize - font-size
        //maily HTML property changed by CamelCasng

        //CSS-DOM Mapping
        //We can modifly CSS Properites by applying between the CSS property and the DOM object. The mapping
        //is direct between CSS property and DOM property:-
        //1. single words are turned as it is
        //2. when there is - then it changed into camelCaseing i.e. background-color = backgroundColor
        //3. vendor prefix changed into camelCased
